## Motivation:
Online news reading has exploded as the web provides access to millions of news sources from around the world. The sheer volume of articles can be overwhelming to readers sometimes.
A key challenge for news service websites is to help users to find news articles that are interesting to read. This is advantageous to both users and news service, as it enables the user to rapidly find what he or she needs and the news service to help retain and increase customer base.
