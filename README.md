## Motivation:
Online news reading has exploded as the web provides access to millions of news sources from around the world. The sheer volume of articles can be overwhelming to readers sometimes.
A key challenge for news service websites is to help users to find news articles that are interesting to read. This is advantageous to both users and news service, as it enables the user to rapidly find what he or she needs and the news service to help retain and increase customer base.

## Objective:
To build a hybrid-filtering personalized news articles recommendation product which can suggest articles from popular news service providers based on reading history of twitter users who share similar interests - **Collaborative filtering** and content similarity of the article and user’s tweets - **Content-based filtering**.
This system can be very helpful to Online News Providers to target right news articles to right users.
